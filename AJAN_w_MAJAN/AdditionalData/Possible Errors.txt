------------------Dedicated neither succes or failure for handleEvent ----------------------
Error: When Dedicated sends a broadcast and the PAYLOAD is queried from Agent Knowledge, then
Participants agents receive the message and respond accordingly. HOWEVER, Dedicated doesn't handle the event which 
should be created when receiving a response from Participants. 
Solution: Read the Payload from Execution Knowledge. To do so, first write everything you need to Exec Knowl. then read for Payload.
